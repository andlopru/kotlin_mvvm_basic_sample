# kotlin_mvvm_basic_sample

Created as a Basic Project with Navigation from the Android Studio options

This project was created to practice latest Android features, in this case:
    -Kotlin
    -Architecture: MVVM
    -Repository pattern
    -Dagger 2
    -Retrofit
    -Room
    -Coroutines
    -Livedata
    
On home fragment there would be a basic recyclerView displaying a list of items(in this case animals) from a public API

#IMPORTANT
Haven't connected the data from the repo to the ViewModel, so no data it's been displayed YET, but you can run and check the data exists on the repo layer.
